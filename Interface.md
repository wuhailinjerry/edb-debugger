The interface is broken down into 4 primary regions.

  * The [Disassembly View](Disassembly.md)
  * The [Register View](Register.md)
  * The [Stack View](Stack.md)
  * The [Data Dump View](Data.md)

Each of these can be dragged, docked, undocked, hidden and shown according to the users preferences and needs.
