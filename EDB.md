# Introduction #

edb is a cross platform x86/x86-64 debugger. It was inspired by [OllyDbg](http://www.ollydbg.de/), but aims to function on x86 and x86-64 as well as multiple OS's. Linux is the only officially supported platform at the moment, but FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX and Windows ports are underway with varying degrees of functionality.
